# AutoML-SHAP for Urban Flood Prediction
This project aims to build a high-precision urban flood depth prediction model by leveraging Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) with diverse geospatial and meteorological data; it also employs SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to interpret the optimal model (XGBoost), providing an in-depth analysis of how environmental factors impact flood formation to offer a scientific basis for urban flood management decisions.
